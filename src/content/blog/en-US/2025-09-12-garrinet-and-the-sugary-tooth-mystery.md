After his successful brushing class, **Garrinet** noticed something strange: some kids still had cavities, even though they brushed their teeth well. Curious, he asked them:

—“What do you eat during snack time?”

Many answered: “Cupcakes! Donuts! Pastries!”

Then he realized the problem: **too much sugar was the real enemy**. The next day, Garrinet returned to school with two plates. On one, he placed pastries and muffins; on the other, fresh, colorful fruits.

—“Today, we’ll learn how to **choose smartly**. Fruit isn’t just tasty—it helps protect your smile!”

He explained that fruits contain vitamins and fiber that strengthen gums, while sugary snacks feed the bacteria that cause cavities.

From that day on, the children started bringing apples, bananas, pears, and carrots for snack time. They even organized a “sugar-free week” at school!

And Garrinet proudly said:

> “A healthy smile starts with what you put on your plate!”
