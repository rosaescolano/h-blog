Garrinet, the little pig, knows that taking care of your mouth is very important for everyone, but especially for people with weak immune systems or who are immunocompromised. That’s why he wants to share some tips for maintaining good oral hygiene without causing harm.

Garrinet explains that in these cases, brushing should be even gentler to avoid irritating the gums. That’s why he uses an ultra-soft toothbrush, which cleans teeth delicately but thoroughly. Garrinet makes gentle circular motions, following the Fones technique, without pressing hard.

Also, Garrinet advises avoiding mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they can dry out the mouth and damage the mucous membranes, making people feel uncomfortable or more prone to infections. Instead, Garrinet recommends rinsing with just water or a special alcohol-free mouthwash.

By following these care tips, Garrinet assures that everyone, even immunocompromised patients, can keep a healthy mouth and avoid problems that may affect their overall health.
