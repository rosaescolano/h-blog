description: Garrinet, the wise little pig, always says that taking good care of
  your teeth is not only good for your health but also helps save money!
  Garrinet explains that when we are little, our first teeth come in for free,
  and when they fall out, the second set also comes at no cost.

He always repeats a very important phrase: "Because in this life, the first teeth are free. The second teeth too. But if you don’t take care of them, the third ones you have to pay for." That’s why Garrinet brushes every day, uses dental floss, and visits the dentist to avoid expensive problems.

If you follow Garrinet’s example and take good care of your teeth from an early age, you’ll avoid unnecessary expenses on treatments and repairs. Taking care of your mouth is a smart saving that guarantees your smile for many years.
