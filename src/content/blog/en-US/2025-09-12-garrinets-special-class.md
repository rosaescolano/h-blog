A few days after his visit to Riudarenes, **Garrinet** received an invitation to give a special class at a school in Barcelona. It was a unique opportunity: the students wanted to learn directly from him how to take care of their teeth!

Wearing his white coat, red beret, and big smile, Garrinet arrived with a model of teeth, several toothbrushes, and lots of energy to teach. The children sat in a circle as he said:

—“Today we’ll become **brushing experts**. Are you ready for the mission?”

Everyone shouted: “Yessss!”

Garrinet demonstrated how to brush step by step: first the top teeth, then the bottom, inside, outside, and even the tongue. Then each child practiced with their own toothbrush on the model. It was so much fun!

—“Remember to brush twice a day for two minutes!” —Garrinet said, while the kids repeated after him.

At the end of the class, each child received a small “Smile Hero” diploma signed by Garrinet. The session ended with applause, laughter, and promises to brush better every day.

Garrinet waved goodbye with his favorite phrase:

> “A clean smile is a happy smile... and strong as an oak!”
