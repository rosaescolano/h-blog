Garrinet, the little pig, knows that to have a beautiful smile and healthy teeth, it is very important to brush well every day. That's why every morning when he wakes up and every night before going to bed, he gets ready to care for his mouth with lots of love using the Fones technique.

First, Garrinet puts a little toothpaste on his toothbrush. Then, he opens his mouth and places the brush perpendicular to his teeth, at the molar area at the back of his mouth. The Fones technique consists of making gentle circular motions, like drawing little circles with the brush. Garrinet starts by brushing the upper teeth, making circles that clean the surface and remove dirt.

Next, he moves the brush to the lower teeth and makes the same gentle circular motion to clean that area too. Garrinet makes sure not to press too hard so he doesnâ€™t hurt his gums. Then, he brushes the front teeth, focusing carefully on each one with circular movements.

Finally, he doesn't forget to brush his tongue to remove bacteria and keep fresh breath. Garrinet rinses his mouth with water and smiles proudly because he knows this routine will keep his teeth strong and happy for a long time.
