In a small corner of Catalonia, where the mountains meet the sea and traditions blend with innovation, a little piglet was born with a very special mission. His name is **Garrinet**, and although at first he might seem like an ordinary piglet, he actually carries a great responsibility!

Since he was little, Garrinet was always a curious piglet, with a bright smile and an endless love for teeth. While other piglets played in the fields, he would spend hours watching people’s smiles and wondering how they kept their teeth so clean and strong. That was when he met a very special group of professionals: **dental hygienists**. They shared all the secrets to keeping a mouth healthy, and Garrinet decided that his mission in life would be to help everyone take care of their smiles.

With his doctor’s coat, his giant toothbrush, and his round glasses, Garrinet became the **ambassador of oral health**. He wasn’t just a friendly face, but also a tireless educator who traveled all around Catalonia to teach children (and grown-ups too) how to brush their teeth properly, avoid harmful sweets, and care for their oral hygiene with passion.

Garrinet soon joined the **Associació d'Higienistes Bucodentals de Catalunya (HIDEs Catalunya)**, a group of experts committed to promoting dental health. Together, they began organizing workshops and campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of regular dental check-ups and maintaining healthy habits for a radiant smile.

With his presence, Garrinet won everyone’s affection. Always accompanied by his unmistakable smile and his enthusiasm for teaching, he became a symbol of **prevention and dental care**. In every city and town he visited, people laughed, learned, and most importantly, started taking better care of their teeth!

His message is clear: **"A healthy smile is a happy smile."** And Garrinet won’t rest until all children and adults in Catalonia have strong, bright, and healthy smiles—because he knows that **oral health is the key to a life full of confidence and joy!**
